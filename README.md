# üå± Plant Disease Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning

This project implements plant disease recognition using deep learning. It compares a Custom CNN, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 on the [Plant Disease Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset).

The models are trained and evaluated on three categories of plant diseases using TensorFlow/Keras with data augmentation, transfer learning, and performance comparison.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset is organized into three splits:

  - Train ‚Üí /Train/Train
  
  - Validation ‚Üí /Validation/Validation
  
  - Test ‚Üí /Test/Test

Each folder contains subdirectories representing the different disease classes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing

   - Rescaling images (1./255)
    
   - Augmentations: horizontal flip, zoom, shear, rotation
    
   - Image size: 128x128, batch size 32
    
2. Models Implemented

   - Custom CNN (5 Conv2D + Dense layers)
    
   - VGG16 (transfer learning with frozen base)
    
   - MobileNetV2 (transfer learning with frozen base)

3. Evaluation

   - Confusion Matrix

   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

   - Accuracy and Loss plots across epochs

   - Model comparison graphs
